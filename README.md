### Inspiration:

We were inspired to make Reppin in order to counter the growing issue of obesity in America.

According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 68.8% of adults are considered to be overweight and 35.7% of them are considered obese.  Reppin looks to change that by making exercising easier.

### How we built it

We built Reppin in Xcode using Objective-C++ and Swift.  We used openCV to perform video analysis and designed our own pattern recognition to identify individual reps from video.  


#### Issues:

When first installing Reppin, the openCV Framework may not be recognized.  To fix that issue, remove the framework then add the framework to the build again.  Reppin must be built on a device to function properly.
